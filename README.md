# Advent of Code 2022

## What language I chose?

TypeScript + Node.js because I'm too lazy to experiment with other languages right now.
It is "scriptable" and "fire and forget", so I could get the solution and go to the next level.

## How to run?

Just use `ts-node` to run the solution from the specific folder, that's all.
